Previous project developped during our "Travail d'Etudes et de Recherches", under the supervision of Jean-Christophe Filli√¢tre (LRI).

This project was developped between January-May 2013, principaly one day a week. For now, it is only an archive repository but some further work could be done "for the fun".

It requires lablgtk2 and cairo, that can be installed via opam.
